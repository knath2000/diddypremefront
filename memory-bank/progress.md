# Progress: Supreme Price Tracker

## Project Status: **FRONTEND CONNECTED TO LIVE BACKEND**
**Current Phase**: Frontend/Backend Integration
**Overall Progress**: Frontend is now connected to the deployed Fly.io backend. Displaying data is blocked by a backend seeding issue.

## What Works ‚úÖ

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Backend Live**: The `diddyback` backend is successfully deployed and stable on Fly.io.

### Frontend-Backend Connection
- ‚úÖ **API Configuration**: The Nuxt frontend is correctly configured with `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to communicate with the live backend.
- ‚úÖ **CORS Resolved**: The backend's CORS policy allows requests from the local frontend (`http://localhost:3000`), and the connection is successful.
- ‚úÖ **Hydration Errors Fixed**: `useFetch` is now configured correctly for server-side rendering, eliminating hydration mismatches.

## What's Left to Build üöß

### üö® Immediate Blockers
- ‚è≥ **Backend Data Seeding**: The frontend cannot display items because the backend's production database is empty. This is the primary blocker.

### Next Steps
1.  **Resolve Backend Seeding**: Await the resolution of the `pnpm db:seed` issue on the backend.
2.  **Verify Data Display**: Confirm that the "Featured Items" list populates correctly once the backend serves data.
3.  **Implement Item Detail Pages**: Build the `[id].vue` and `prices.vue` pages to display detailed information for a single item.
4.  **Build out Remaining UI**: Implement the `trending` and `alerts` pages.

## Major Accomplishments This Session ‚ú®
- **Connected Frontend to Live Backend**: Successfully configured the Nuxt app to fetch data from the deployed Fly.io service.
- **Resolved CORS Errors**: Implemented and configured the `cors` middleware on the Express backend to allow cross-origin requests.
- **Fixed Vue Hydration Mismatch**: Correctly configured `useFetch` to prevent mismatches between server-rendered and client-rendered content.
- **Debugged API Connectivity**: Systematically diagnosed the lack of data by confirming the backend connection was successful but the database was empty.
