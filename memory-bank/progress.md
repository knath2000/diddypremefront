# Progress: Diddypreme Frontend

## Project Status: **LIVE & STABLE WITH STOCKX DATA**
**Current Phase**: UI/UX Redesign
**Overall Progress**: The frontend is stable, fully connected to the backend, and correctly displaying real-time StockX price data. The focus has now shifted to a major visual and interactive overhaul.

## What Works âœ…

### Core Functionality
- âœ… **End-to-End Data Flow**: Successfully fetches and displays complex, nested data from the live `diddyback` API, including variant-specific prices.
- âœ… **StockX Price Display**:
    -   Item detail pages show the latest "Lowest Ask" for each variant.
    -   Price history pages and charts correctly display StockX data series when selected.
- âœ… **Stable & Performant**: All major bugs have been resolved.
    -   **No Hydration Errors**: Server-side rendering is working correctly.
    -   **Smooth Navigation**: Page transitions are fast and reliable.
    -   **No Build Errors**: All dependency and import issues have been fixed.

### UI & Components
- âœ… **Charting**: The `StockChart.vue` component correctly renders historical price data.
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: The existing layout is functional across mobile and desktop.

## What's Left to Build ðŸš§

### Next Steps
1.  **UI Redesign (Glasmorphism)**: Implement the new "colorful glasmorphism" design system across the entire application.
2.  **Add Animation & Motion**: Integrate a motion library to make the UI more dynamic and engaging.
3.  **Build Gamification Features**: Create the frontend components to support the new gamification system (XP, badges, etc.).

## Major Accomplishments This Session âœ¨
### PR Review and Merges (Squash) â€“ 2025-08-11
- Squash-merged PR #2 (refactor + composables + design tokens) into `main`.
- Squash-merged PR #1 (ItemCard refactor + TS improvements) into `main` with tested conflict resolutions.
- Deleted remote feature branches after merge.

### Build and CI Readiness
- Resolved Tailwind v4 strict-mode issues by replacing `@apply` usages in component-scoped CSS with pure CSS fallbacks in key files: `AppHeader.vue`, `AppFooter.vue`, `LoadingSpinner.vue`, `PriceBubble.vue`, `TrendIndicator.vue`, and `pages/items/[id].vue`.
- Unified `nuxt.config.ts` to PR #2â€™s structure (Chart.js transpile; removed invalid `nitro.errorHandler`).
- Added `focus-trap` to satisfy `@vueuse/integrations` SSR build.
- Verified production build locally (client + server) from merged code.
