# Progress: Diddypreme Frontend

## Project Status: **LIVE & STABLE WITH STOCKX DATA**
**Current Phase**: UI/UX Redesign
**Overall Progress**: The frontend is stable, fully connected to the backend, and correctly displaying real-time StockX price data. The focus has now shifted to a major visual and interactive overhaul.

## What Works âœ…

### Core Functionality
- âœ… **End-to-End Data Flow**: Successfully fetches and displays complex, nested data from the live `diddyback` API, including variant-specific prices.
- âœ… **StockX Price Display**:
    -   Item detail pages show the latest "Lowest Ask" for each variant.
    -   Price history pages and charts correctly display StockX data series when selected.
- âœ… **Stable & Performant**: All major bugs have been resolved.
    -   **No Hydration Errors**: Server-side rendering is working correctly.
    -   **Smooth Navigation**: Page transitions are fast and reliable.
    -   **No Build Errors**: All dependency and import issues have been fixed.

### UI & Components
- âœ… **Charting**: The `StockChart.vue` component correctly renders historical price data.
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: The existing layout is functional across mobile and desktop.

## What's Left to Build ðŸš§

### Next Steps
1.  **UI Redesign (Glasmorphism)**: Implement the new "colorful glasmorphism" design system across the entire application.
2.  **Add Animation & Motion**: Integrate a motion library to make the UI more dynamic and engaging.
3.  **Build Gamification Features**: Create the frontend components to support the new gamification system (XP, badges, etc.).

## Major Accomplishments This Session âœ¨
- **Successfully Integrated StockX Data**: Transformed the UI to consume and display real-time, variant-level market data from the backend, including building new pages and chart components.
- **Resolved Critical Production-Level Bugs**: Systematically debugged and fixed a series of challenging issues that are common in modern web development:
    -   Fixed **SSR hydration mismatches** by correcting backend CORS policies and frontend data fetching strategies.
    -   Solved **client-side navigation failures** by managing experimental Nuxt features.
    -   Addressed **Vite build errors** by handling dependency imports correctly for a universal rendering context.
- **Stabilized the Application**: Moved the application from a buggy, partially-integrated state to a stable, fully functional baseline ready for future development.
- **Refined Data Display**: Updated the UI to show the most relevant price (`Lowest Ask`) for a better user experience.
