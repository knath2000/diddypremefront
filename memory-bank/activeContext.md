# Active Context: Diddypreme Frontend

## Current Focus
The primary focus has shifted from bug fixing to a complete User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) overhaul. The goal is to transform the application into a highly engaging, animated, and visually rich platform using a "colorful glasmorphism" aesthetic.

## Current State
- **StockX Data Integrated**: The frontend now successfully fetches and displays variant-level StockX data.
    - The item detail page (`/items/[id].vue`) shows the latest "Lowest Ask" or "Last Sale" price for each individual variant.
    - A dedicated StockX market page (`/items/[id]/stockx.vue`) displays a 30-day price history chart using Chart.js.
- **Critical Bugs Resolved**:
    - **Hydration Mismatches**: Fixed by resolving backend CORS issues and enabling server-side rendering for all data fetches.
    - **Navigation Errors**: Resolved page transition timeouts by disabling the experimental `viewTransition` feature in Nuxt.
    - **Vite Import Errors**: Fixed a build error by dynamically importing the `chartjs-adapter-date-fns` dependency.
- **Dependencies Added**: `chart.js`, `vue-chartjs`, and `chartjs-adapter-date-fns` have been added to support price charting.

## Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Implement New Design System**: Begin executing on the "colorful glasmorphism" redesign plan.
    -   Update Tailwind CSS configuration with a new, vibrant color palette.
    -   Redesign core components like `ItemCard.vue` and `AppHeader.vue` to use blurred, semi-transparent backgrounds and other glassmorphism effects.
2.  **Integrate Animation**: Introduce an animation library (like VueUse's `useMotion`) to add fluid page transitions and interactive micro-animations.
3.  **Build Gamification UI**: Start scaffolding the frontend components for the new gamification features, such as "Hype Point" notifications and achievement badges.
