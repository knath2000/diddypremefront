# Active Context: Diddypreme Frontend

## Current Focus
The primary focus has shifted from bug fixing to a complete User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) overhaul. The goal is to transform the application into a highly engaging, animated, and visually rich platform using a "colorful glasmorphism" aesthetic.

## Current State
- **PRs merged into `main`**: PR #2 (refactors/composables) and PR #1 (ItemCard TS refactor) merged via squash; branches deleted.
- **StockX Data Integrated**: The frontend fetches and displays variant-level StockX data.
  - Item detail page shows latest StockX prices per variant.
  - StockX market page displays 30-day history with Chart.js.
- **Build stability**:
  - Tailwind v4 strict-mode issues resolved by replacing `@apply` in component styles with CSS fallbacks.
  - `nuxt.config.ts` aligned to PR #2; invalid `nitro.errorHandler` removed; Chart.js transpile ensured.
  - `focus-trap` added for `@vueuse/integrations`.

## Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Implement New Design System**: Begin executing on the "colorful glasmorphism" redesign plan.
    -   Update Tailwind CSS configuration with a new, vibrant color palette.
    -   Redesign core components like `ItemCard.vue` and `AppHeader.vue` to use blurred, semi-transparent backgrounds and other glassmorphism effects.
2.  **Integrate Animation**: Introduce an animation library (like VueUse's `useMotion`) to add fluid page transitions and interactive micro-animations.
3.  **Build Gamification UI**: Start scaffolding the frontend components for the new gamification features, such as "Hype Point" notifications and achievement badges.
