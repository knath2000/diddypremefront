# Active Context: Supreme Price Tracker

## Current Focus
Enhancing the item details page to display the rich data now available from the backend, including color variants, image galleries, and detailed release information.

## Current State
- ✅ **Data Ingestion Complete**: The backend's NeonDB has been successfully populated with detailed item data, including multiple color variants and image galleries, using a local HTML parsing script.
- ✅ **Backend API Updated**: The `/api/items/:id` endpoint now correctly serves all the new data, including related `Variant` and `ItemImage` records.
- ✅ **Item Card Images Fixed**: The `ItemCard.vue` component was patched to correctly display item images by checking for both `image_url` and `imageUrl` properties.
- ✅ **Homepage Grid Implemented**: The featured items on the homepage now display in a responsive 3x3 grid on large screens.
- ✅ **Details Page Enhanced**: The `pages/items/[id].vue` page has been significantly upgraded to:
    -   Display a full image gallery with clickable thumbnails.
    -   Show detailed information like release week, release date, and retail price.
    -   List all available colorways.
- ✅ **Hydration Errors Resolved**: The `useFetch` call on the details page was configured to run on the server, fixing the SSR hydration mismatch errors.

## Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Price History**: Implement the price history page at `pages/items/[id]/prices.vue`, which is currently empty.
2.  **UI/UX Refinements**: Polish the new elements on the item details page, potentially adding features like a more advanced image carousel or better styling for the color variants.
3.  **Testing**: Thoroughly test the item details page with various items to ensure all data is displayed correctly and gracefully handles items with missing information (e.g., no variants, no images).
