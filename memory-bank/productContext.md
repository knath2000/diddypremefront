# Product Context: Supreme Price Tracker

## Why This Project Exists

The streetwear resale market has exploded into a multi-billion dollar industry, with Supreme being one of the most coveted brands. However, price discovery across multiple platforms is fragmented and time-consuming, creating several pain points for users.

## Problems We Solve

### 1. **Price Discovery Fragmentation**
- **Problem**: Users must manually check StockX, GOAT, Grailed, and other platforms individually
- **Pain**: Time-consuming process leads to missed opportunities
- **Solution**: Centralized price aggregation with real-time updates

### 2. **Historical Data Blindness**
- **Problem**: Platforms show limited price history, making trend analysis difficult
- **Pain**: Users can't identify optimal buy/sell timing
- **Solution**: Comprehensive historical charting with trend indicators

### 3. **Manual Alert Management**
- **Problem**: No unified alerting system across platforms
- **Pain**: Users miss price drops or favorable selling conditions
- **Solution**: Intelligent price alerts with customizable thresholds

### 4. **Market Information Asymmetry**
- **Problem**: Casual users lack access to advanced market analytics
- **Pain**: Professional resellers have unfair advantages
- **Solution**: Democratized access to market intelligence
